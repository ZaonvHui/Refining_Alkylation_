Reproduction of the article "PROCESS OPTIMIZATION OF A BUTANE-BUTENE ALKYLATION PLANT". 
CSTR_Structure1;CSTR_Structure2;CSTR_Structure1_output;CSTR_Structure2_output are initial analysis of feasibility of two control structures. 
three_reactor;three_reactor_output are initial analysis of feasibility of the extended structure with three reactors. 
one_reactor_opt;three_reactor_C1_opt;three_reactor_C2_opt;three_reactor_C3_opt;three_reactor_C4_opt are optimization for the five trials.
